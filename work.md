# Work Experience

## Staff Software Engineer
**Google** | Kubernetes Security Team | *2019 - Present*

As the technical lead I architected the roadmap and provided leadership for a 7 member software and security engineering team focused on hardening Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and OSS Kubernetes.

Facilitated secure, large-scale adoption of GKE for critical internal first-party services (1Ps), such as Vertex AI Agent Engine, by establishing the platform for Agentic Sandboxes.

Spearheaded the design and deployment of the ShipShape service, a proprietary policy engine. This system proactively detects and mitigates thousands of Kubernetes security misconfigurations across GKE and high-priority Google 1Ps, significantly enhancing overall platform security posture.

Drove key security improvements in OSS Kubernetes by collaborating with Kubernetes SIGs to propose and implement critical Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals (KEPs) that elevated security defaults, including [KEP-4633], [KEP-5040], and [KEP-2862]


## Software Engineer
**Microsoft** | Office Security Team | *2016 - 2019*

Developed and launched Microsoft Safelinks, a critical security feature that safeguards millions of Office 365 users by seamlessly integrating real-time link reputation checks across all Office applications.

Invented and implemented the Security Policy Advisor (US Patent 10,454,952 B2), an intelligent service that leverages organizational usage patterns to generate data-driven security policy recommendations for tenant administrators.


## Software Engineering Intern
**Microsoft** | Office PowerPoint Team | *Summer 2015*

Enhanced PowerPoint's user experience by implementing and refining Smart Guides, significantly improving the ease and precision with which users can align and snap shapes.

Experimented 3D Printing functionality in PowerPoint by developing and implementing an .obj exporter capable of processing entire slideshows and preparing 3D shapes for physical printing.
